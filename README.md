# Fun project to try out!

## The idea

This is an interactive web application which is designed to limit users to doing things in certain way while preventing them to skip any steps. You should be aware that confusing user experience is **intended** and not a design flaw. Frustration is part of the game just as much as it is part of programming.

## Gameplay

Since the game is meant for people who are learning computer science it is highly encouraged to use any developer tools and techniques to find the hidden elements of the game. Use inspect element and all browser functionality it has to offer, and practice persistence at solving the task at hand. Further development of the game will focus more on actual debugging skills and computer science knowledge.

## Running the project locally

If you want to try running project locally, just clone it, do `yarn install` in root folder and `yarn dev` to run the project.
